# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
### Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

# 1. Introduction
 ***Need to fill this part in***

# 2. Scenario

I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share
company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the team wants to
understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes dierently. From these
insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, so they must be
backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### Characters & Teams

* **Cyclistic**   
A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600
docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand
tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities
and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for
traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more
likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.
* **Lily Moreno**   
The director of marketing and our manager. Moreno is responsible for
the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.
These may include email, social media, and other channels.
* **Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team**   
A team of data analysts who are responsible for
collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.
I joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s
mission and business goals, as well as how I can help Cyclistic achieve them.
* **Cyclistic Executive Team**   
The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide
whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

### About the Company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown
to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across
Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the
system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to
broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the
flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable
than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers,
Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.
Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes
there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders
are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into
annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to beer understand how
annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how
digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in
analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

# 3. Data Analysis Process
In this Case Study, I will be using a 6 step analysis process to solve the problem.
Those steps are as follows:
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act

### **Step One: Ask**
The Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team came up with three questions that will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes dierently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Moreno has assigned me the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual
riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

### **Step Two: Prepare**
**Data Source**   
Because Cyclistic is a fictitional company, I will be using the data from the [City of Chicago’s Divvy bicycle sharing service](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
Specifically, I will be using the January 2024 - December 2024 data to analyze and identify current trends in riders behavior. 

**Data Organization**  
The data is organized by month, and follows the naming covention of *"YYYYMM-divvy-tripdata"*. Each dataset includes all of the trips
that were completed in the month, and contains the following data column names:   
* ride_id
* rideable_type
* started_at
* ended_at
* start_station_name
* start_station_id
* end_station_name
* end_station_id
* start_lat
* start_lng
* end_lat
* end_lng
* member_casual

**ROCCC**  
ROCCC is an acronym that is used to help determine weither a dataset is biased. It stands for  

R- Reliable  
O- Original  
C- Comprehensive  
C- Current  
C- Cited  

The dataset comes directly from Divvy's parent company Lyft Bikes and Scooters LLC, so I can be sure that the data is reliable, original, and cited.
There are 13 columns of data for each trip so the data is comprehensive, and the datasets were created days after the months end making them current.
